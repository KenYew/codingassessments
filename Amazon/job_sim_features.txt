Preliminary thoughts

Feature 1:
- allows us to establish a new relationship with 3rd party services
- requires an amazon product manager
- system only designed to interact with social media platform A and B, so needs extensive re-fatoring to generalise to social media platforms
- Social media platform B has a rapidly growing user-base and is largely comprised of a younger demographic
- Interacting with social media platform B could generate more revenue for Amazon

Feature 2:
- Introduces crashes to the application when shared on certain devices
- Research shows that there is a corerlation between crashing and order abandonment
- External team has aligning interest to implement this option - more on board with Feature 2
- Doesn't require as much coordination across team
- Takes approximately half the time to implement as Feature 1

Thanks for the great meeting earlier today. I think this is a good opportunity for us to really have a positive
impact on customer experience as we continue to develope features to improve customer interactions with our website!
In order to implement any of these features, we'll need to get on the external team's roadmap for routine releases.

1. Which of the following are pros of implementing Feature 1? Select four advantages of implementing Feature 1

- Doesn't require reconfiguring existing code
- Scalable across multiple platforms
- More revenue for Amazon (/)
- Potentially develops long-term relationships with a younger demographic (/)
- Allows for more engagement across multiple social media platforms
- Would be a good opportunity to boost revenue (/)
- Allows opportunity to network with Amazon colleagues/external vendors (/)

2. Which of the following are pros of implementing Feature 2? Select two advantages of implementing Feature 2

- Allows for a better customer experience due to the reduction/elimination of crashes
- Opportunity to build a good working relatinoship with the external team
- Easier to implement than Feature 1, so it should be prioritized (/)
- Significant potential for increased revenues/sales
- The external team will likely be more willing to assist with Feature 2 (/)

3. Which feature would you recommend?

- feature 1 (/)
- feature 2

#################################################################################
Jeff just told me that you're recommending we go with Feature 1. I know you're new in this role and I appreciate your input,
but I think we should go with Feature 2. Let me know if you want to discuss and we can talk things through. Thanks

4. What is the FIRST step you should take to resolve this disagreement? Rate the effectiveness

A: Meet with the senior engineers and other high-level decision makers (e.g. manager, directors) to get their input (2)
B: Ask your manager for guidance on the decision (4)
C: Set up meeting with Kelly Ling and external team to decide which feature to implement (2)
D: Go with Kelly Ling's recommendation since she is more experienced than you (5)
E: Go with your own opinion because you've already weighted the pros and cons and know what will have most impact for Amazon (5)
F: Take a vote on our team because both approaches have pros and cons (3)

#################################################################################
Thanks for all of your input on the new feature. I'm excited to announce that we are going to move forward with feature 1.
We think this will provide our customers with the best possible experience. However, we will need the feature to work seamlessly
with other social media platforms (i.e. social media C, D, and E). We will also need to get this feature implemented within
the next 3 months. I realise this is an aggressive timeline, but I'm confident you will be able to meet this challenge.

5. Given this new information, what do you need to do in order to deliver the new feature within the given timeline?
Rate the effectiveness

A: Do not extensively test in order to meet the deadline and be able to deliver results within the deadline (5)
B: Start working on it even though you know it probably won't get done.
    After a few weeks, report your progress to your manager and request additional resources (4)
C: On your own, ask other team members if they can pitch in and help (4)
D: Push back on the requirements and suggest only integrating with 1 or 2 additional social media platforms (3)
E: Plan to work overtime alone in order to get it done (5)
F: Tell your manager that you cannot complete this by yourself and suggest your manager bring in additional resources (2)
G: Prioritize social media platforms and work on the most critical first and delay other platforms until after the deadline (2)
