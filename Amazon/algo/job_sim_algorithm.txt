Attached are the results of the two different algorithms as applied to deliveries conducted over the past 3 days
(recall that the team developed algorithms based on 100 days of delivery data):
- Hourly traffic, available routes
- population density
- number of available drivers in the area
- number of delivers per area

Remember our golas for the routes are:
- enable 80 deliveries per day
- should not exceed 200 miles

These goals support route efficiency, which reduces pressure on deliver drivers and our distribution system
Which algorithm do you want to go forward with?
#################################################################################

1. How would you like to proceed? Rate the effectiveness

A: Recommend gathering data for an additional 3 days before making a decision (5)
B: Recommend algorithm #1 because the goal for deliveries per route is more consistently met (2)
C: Recommend algorithm #2 because the number of deliveries per hour is more consistent (4)
D: Recommend algorithm #2 because the mileage goal is more consistently met (2)
E: Recommend algorithm #1 because the mileage per route is lower (5)

2. If you could request additional information. What would help you to determine the better algorithm?
Select the two (2) most relevant response options:

- Map of the city and surrounding area
- Driver performance during the 3-day timeframe
- Data on the algorithm factors from the 100-day development timeframe (/)
- Predicted future trends in data that may impact efficiency of the algorithms
- Whether number of deliveries or mileage is the higher priority (/)

I was able to get the updated hourly traffic information related to these algorithms for the past 3 days. Take a look and see if
this is helpful in making your decision. I've also included the original aggregate traffic data used to build the algorithm.
Remember that we need to lauch this feature in the next 3 days. Thanks

3. What is your final recommendation? Select the best response

- Recommend algorithm #2 because the variability in mileage is accounted for by traffic patterns
- No conclusive decision can be made with the given data
- Recommend algorithm #2 because the milage goal is more consistently met (/)
- Propose development of a new algorithm that better accounts for traffic patterns
- Recommend algorithm #1 because the goal for deliveries per route is more consistently met
