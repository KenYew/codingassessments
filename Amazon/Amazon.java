    // Q1:
    // Amazon prides itself on protecting customers and sellers from fraud. Amazon assigns fraud ratings to actions taken on the website.
    // We scan these rating values to try and determine when to accept a given request. Fraud ratings are assigned in a complementary manner.
    // When two ratings add up to a certain value, it increases the risk that the request may be fraudulent.
    // Write an algorithm to find the number of distinct pair of ratings from an array of all fraud ratings for the request that sum to a target value

    // Q2:
    // Amazon wants to pilet hardware replacements in Data Centre AMZN525, to increase the reliability of their network.
    // AMZN525 has a "connected" network of data servers, i.e. every server can communicate with the rest of the network.
    // The data servers are connected by point-to-point cables to establish "critical" or "non-critical" connections.
    // A connection is considered "critical" if its removal results in a disconnected network of servers.
    // Amazon wants to significantly increase the reliability of its Data Centers by replacing the critical connections with far more reliable cables.
    // Write a method that returns the critical connections in AMZN525

    // input:
    // 1) - numOfServers
    // 2) - numOfConnections
    // 3) - connections

    // output:
    // - Return a list of integer pairs representing the critical connections. Output an empty list
