Some customer have told me that they are unable to look up certain produces on our retail website. I have also verified that
these pages do not load. I will send you a ticket that shows the last 20 requests to the website as well as the log report ot the page.
Can you figure out what is causing the pages to break?

1. What additional information would be helpful to better understand this problem?
Rate the relevance of each response options

A: Customer brower versions (1)
B: Customer region (4)
C: Customer session ID
D: Screenshot of the error page (1)
E: URL for the page

2. How would you go about finding the issues with the resouces available to you?
Rate the effectiveness of each response option

A: Tell the technician this is a one-time glitch and should resolve itself (5)
B: Go to the code directly and try to find the bug manually (4)
C: Immediately ask a more experienced engineer for assistance since it is an urgent issue (3)
D: Look at the metrics e.g. latency, throughput, error couts, number of requests and look for strange behaviour (1)
E: Search the logs for errors in the timeframe that the error occured (1)
F: Analyse the logs for specific requests that might have failed (1)
G: Investigate the failed requests but ignore the valid requests (4)

3. After investigating the available resources what do you think is the root cause? Selet the best option

- requests that have an even request id number are causing issues
- requests in which customer-reviews and the customer-rating arrays do not have the same number of elements are causing issues
- requests that have the color set to grey are causing issues
- requests that have the product name as "Fire TV" are causing issues or requests that are less than 10s apart are causing issues
- requests that have two spaces in the product name are failing their service calls and throwing UnableToLoadPageException
- There is no issue, it was a false

I heard about the issue with Dai. I know you ran into similar situation a few weeks ago. Would you be able to
come up with a plan to make sure this doesn't happen again? I would like you to prioritize this so we can ensure
this situation doesn't happen again. Thanks!
